TODO for limesurvey Debian packaging
------------------------------------

- change default admin password, ask at package setup, or disable
- change Apache include file, comment out actual Alias and document this in the
  Debian README
- remove binary font files from admin/classes/tcpdf/fonts from the source
  archive. Done for the binary package
- move index.php and admin.php (and maybe other user accessible scripts) to
  something like /usr/share/limesurvey/www and only expose that directory
  directly through Apache
- check all licenses
- fix remaining Lintian errors and warnings
