 downloaded from

 Clarification for the Oxygen icons:
 .
 The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for
 software libraries in the first place. We expressly want the LGPL to
 be valid for this artwork library too.
 .
 KDE Oxygen theme icons is a special kind of software library, it is an
 artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
 GUI.
 .
 Source code, for this library means:
  - where they exist, SVG;
  - otherwise, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or
 otherwise png.
 .
 The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
 notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.
 .
 With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
 containing the elements. You may follow this practice.
 .
 The exception in section 5 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
 the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.

  cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
  be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
  recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
  constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
  the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the

  such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms

  which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
  with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
  independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
  collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
  considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this

 .
  (e) "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
  work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
  the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the

 .
  (f) "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
  terms of this License including without limitation any production in
  the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the
  mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a
  book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or
  other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work;

  architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
  compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
  work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the
  extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
 .
  (g) "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
  License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
  with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
  from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
  previous violation.
 .
  (h) "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
  Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by
  any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
  digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
  a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place
  and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to
  the public by any means or process and the communication to the
  public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital
  performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means
  including signs, sounds or images.
 .
  (i) "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
  including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the
  right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including
  storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or
  other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights.
 .
  Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict
  any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
  exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
  protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant.
 .
  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
  grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
  the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
  rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
  (a) to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
  Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
  Collections;
 .
  (b) to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
  Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
  reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
  that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
  translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
  English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
  work has been modified.";
 .
  (c) to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
  incorporated in Collections; and,
 .
  (d) to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
  (e) For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.
 .
        In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
        through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be
        waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect
        such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
        under this License;
 .
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes.
 .
        In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
        through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be
        waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect
        such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
        under this License; and,
 .
   iii. Voluntary License Schemes.
 .
        The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
        individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of
        a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
        schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the
        rights granted under this License.
 .
  The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
  now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
  to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
  the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
  rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.
 .
  The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
  and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  (a) You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
  terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
  Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
  Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
  any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
  ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
  to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
  sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
  this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
  the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
  Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
  technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
  recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
  that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
  applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
  not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
  subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
  upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
  remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b),
  as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
  Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
  Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
 .
  (b) If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
  Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made
  pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the
  Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
  utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
  applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
  Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
  institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
  Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
  other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
  title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
  practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
  associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
  copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
  consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
  identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
  translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
  original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this
  Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
  however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
  minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
  authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of
  these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
  for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
  may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
  attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your
  rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
  assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by
  the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
  appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
  express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor
  and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
  (c) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
  be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
  Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part
  of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate,
  modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which
  would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or
  reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
  (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section
  3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed
  to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
  action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation,
  the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section,
  to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to
  enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
  this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
  LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
  STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
  TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
  NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
  ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
  DISCOVERABLE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability.
 .
  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
  LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
  OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  (a) This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
  License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
  Collections from You under this License, however, will not have
  their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
  remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
  7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 .
  (b) Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
  here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
  the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
  release the Work under different license terms or to stop
  distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
  election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
  license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
  of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
  effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  (a) Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
  Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
  Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
  under this License.
 .
  (b) Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
  Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on
  the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
  this License.
 .
  (c) If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
  under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
  enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
  without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
  provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
  such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
  (d) No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
  no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
  writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
  consent.
 .
  (e) This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
  parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
  understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
  Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
  additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
  You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
  agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
  (f) The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
  this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
  Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
  amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
  WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
  Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
  July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
  relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
  enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
  implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
  law.  If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
  copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
  License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
  License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
  rights under applicable law.

  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
  grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
  the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
  rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
  (a) to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
  Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
  Collections;
 .
  (b) to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
  Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
  reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
  that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
  translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
  English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
  work has been modified.";
 .
  (c) to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
  incorporated in Collections; and,
 .
  (d) to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
  (e) For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.  In those
        jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
        any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
        the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
        royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
        this License;
 .
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes.  In those jurisdictions
        in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory
        or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor
        waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
        and,
 .
   iii. Voluntary License Schemes.  The Licensor waives the right to
        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
        the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
        administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
        from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
        License.
 .
   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
   now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
   to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
   the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
   rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.
 .
  The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
  and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  (a) You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
  terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
  Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
  Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
  any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
  ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
  to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
  sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
  this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
  the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
  Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
  technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
  recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
  that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
  applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
  not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
  subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
  upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
  remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c),
  as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
  Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
  Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
  requested.
 .
  (b) You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under
  the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License
  with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative
  Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
  version) that contains the same License Elements as this License
  (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
  Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the
  licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
  license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the
  licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
  you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally
  and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the
  URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation
  You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose
  any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the
  Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
  to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
  the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
  refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
  with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
  Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly
  Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
  technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability
  of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights
  granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
  License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated
  in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from
  the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
  Applicable License.
 .
  (c) If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
  Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made
  pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the
  Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
  utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
  applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
  Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
  institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
  Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
  other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
  title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
  practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
  associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
  copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
  consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
  credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
  "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
  based on original Work by Original Author").  The credit required by
  this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
  provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection,
  at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
  contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then
  as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as
  the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
  doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
  purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by
  exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
  explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
  endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
  Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
  separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
  Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
  (d) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
  be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
  Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part
  of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate,
  modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which
  would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or
  reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
  (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section
  3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed
  to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
  action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation,
  the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section,
  to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to
  enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
  this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
  LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
  STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
  TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
  NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
  ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
  DISCOVERABLE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability.
 .
  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
  LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
  OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  (a) This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
  License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
  Collections from You under this License, however, will not have
  their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
  remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
  7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 .
  (b) Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
  here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
  the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
  release the Work under different license terms or to stop
  distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
  election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
  license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
  of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
  effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  (a) Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
  Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
  Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
  under this License.
 .
  (b) Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
  Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on
  the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
  this License.
 .
  (c) If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
  under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
  enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
  without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
  provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
  such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
  (d) No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
  no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
  writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
  consent.
 .
  (e) This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
  parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
  understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
  Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
  additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
  You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
  agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
  (f) The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
  this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
  Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
  amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
  WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
  Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
  July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
  relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
  enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
  implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
  law.  If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
  copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
  License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
  License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
  rights under applicable law.

 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.
 .
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 .
     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 .
          (c) Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.
 .
     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.
 .
     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.
 .
     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.
 .
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
 .
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.
 .
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.
 .
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.
 .
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 .
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
 .
     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
